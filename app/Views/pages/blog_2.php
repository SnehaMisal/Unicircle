                    <p>Gen Z-ers practically exit the womb gripping a smartphone (98 percent use one). As a new wave of
                        college students make their transition onto campus, universities benefit from communicating to
                        these text messaging natives with a range of informational, logistical, and promotional content.
                        These notifications also act to build student engagement.</p>
                    <p>
                        As incoming freshmen know, navigating college can mean juggling a variety of new
                        responsibilities. Accessing the full spectrum of resources available at their institution can be
                        confusing. SMS is an excellent channel for connecting students to activities, informing them
                        about financial resources, communicating safety and health information, and keeping them on top
                        of their classes.

                        <p>Push notifications are one of the most commonly used engagement channels for many websites
                            from domains like media publishers, eCommerce, job portals, and many more. Using push
                            notifications is important for any type of growth in any market.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, what does that mean for user engagement? Why not use push notifications for colleges
                            and universities that have thousands of students? </p>
                        <p>It is not surprising that college students expect personalized communication from their
                            universities, with most of today's technology already catering to them. </p>
                        <p>According to the 2021 Connected Student Report by Salesforce, around 50% of the surveyed
                            students want to have personalized communications from their colleges. Personalized and
                            segmented emails are a more common way to get the message to the right people, but it is not
                            as effective. In 2020, 34.3% was recorded for an open rate for higher education emails.
                            Still, they will tend to drop into the low 20% once classes are resumed. </p>
                        <p>What are the best methods to communicate with students in a way that will capture their
                            attention? Send them a mobile push notification.</p>

                        <p>
                            Most college students tend to always have a phone on them, just being a part of the modern
                            age of technology. Mobile phones have become a large part of daily life, which is for most
                            people. Smartphones are the main thing that most college students have. A survey showed that
                            around 96% of adults between the ages of 18 and 29 have a smartphone. Most colleges have
                            started to embrace being mobile-first or adapting digital transformations, so colleges must
                            have a mobile app for the student portal. Mobile-first means that colleges will begin
                            personalizing how students can engage with the world through technology and not just an app
                            that can be downloaded and used.

                        </p>
                        <p>Mobile strategies that work flip the script from requiring students to search for information
                            to present them with tailored information. According to a Salesforce report, most students
                            would like to receive as many alerts, emails, personalized messages, and reminders as they
                            do now. In an unmistakable message, students want direct access to personalized assistance.
                        </p>
                        <p>Messages that are of direct interest to them (for example, a tutoring appointment offered due
                            to </p>
                        <p>It's best to send them alerts about their campus (they're unlikely to check their email while
                            driving to campus and don't care if a parking lot is closed on another campus.)</p>
                        <p>A reminder about deadlines coming up (such as choosing student housing but only if they live
                            on campus)</p>
                        <p>Student portals provide highly-personalized information that is extended to mobile push
                            notifications to create highly-tailored communication strategies. Many colleges face
                            communication challenges because they don't have a mobile app or aren't using customizable
                            push notifications.</p>
                        <p><i> (The below graphic visualizes why push notifications are beginning to see more widespread
                                use for more personalized, impactful communications for students.)</i></p>
                        <p><i>(As you can see, email notifications can easily get lost in the noise whereas a targeted
                                push notification offers greater relevance, brandability, and urgency.)</i></p>

                        <h2 class=" ">Push notifications for mobile devices: Why are they necessary?</h2>
                        <p>One of the primary benefits of mobile push notifications is that they are the best way to
                            ensure that critical information is seen.
                        </p>

                        <p>34% of your recipients are opening your email, which means 66% aren't responding. This may be
                            due to inbox fatigue. They might not check their email. Perhaps school emails are being sent
                            to spam. They might not care. There are several reasons why this may occur. The most
                            important thing is that your communications aren't reaching your target audience.</p>
                        <p>When students are required to open an app, visit a website, or sign in, it creates an
                            obstacle that your message must cross. Whenever they receive a push notification, it will
                            appear so that it can't be missed. </p>
                        <p>Many students are prepared to opt-in for push notifications for something as important as
                            school communications. Airship's benchmark report for 2021 shows that mobile push
                            notification opt-in rates for Android users are 89.4% and for iOS users are 72.9%. (Android
                            automatically opts users in to receive notifications, whereas iOS requires users to opt in.)
                            Send students your notifications: they're eager to get them!</p>
                        <p>The mobile push notification also trumps the text (SMS) message. The student will receive the
                            notifications as long as they download the app and opt-in to receive them. Students are not
                            required to know how to opt back into text messages if they opt out or change their phone
                            number.</p>

                        <p>Today's students were raised in a digital world, and tomorrow's students are only going to be
                            a more significant part of the digital era. They will have an affinity for personalized
                            content. The media and apps competing for their attention will not go away. The only way to
                            truly capture their attention is to put it in front of their eyes with minimal effort.
                            Please do not make them check emails and do not make them use website functions to search or
                            ask questions on social media. Push personalized and essential information to them directly
                            in the most engaging way possible. The power of using push notifications and providing
                            information to users without them needing them to hunt is the most significant
                            transformation of being mobile-first.

                            Open rates for SMS marketing campaigns are much higher than emails. Text messages have a 97
                            percent read rate within 15 minutes of receipt.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="  font-weight-bold">Smartphone Usage:</span> On college campuses,
                            smartphone usage is almost universal. In a survey conducted on undergraduates and
                            Information Technology, 95 percent of undergraduates were found to own a smartphone.</p>
                        <p><span class="  font-weight-bold">Personal Preference: </span>College students are
                            highly receptive to text updates. One study revealed that two thirds of freshmen and their
                            parents found texts to be helpful and informative for communicating important dates. Another
                            study found that people are more likely to open a text message before any other form of
                            communication they receive.</p>
                        <p><span class="  font-weight-bold">Audience Variety: </span>SMS, unlike mobile and web
                            push, is not limited to individuals who have downloaded an app, or are active on their
                            browser. Because SMS subscribers opt-in from different sources, they represent a new
                            audience with different expectations than push and email subscribers.</p>
                        <p>Texting is comfortable, preferred, and natural for this demographic.</p>
