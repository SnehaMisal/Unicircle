                    <h2>What type of cookies does Unicircle use?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies can either be session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires
                        automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or
                        you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire
                        after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years. Cookies placed by the website
                        you’re visiting are called “first party cookies”.</p>
                    <p>Strictly Necessary cookies are necessary for our website/app to function and cannot be switched
                        off in our systems. They are essential in order to enable you to navigate around the website/app
                        and use its features. If you remove or disable these cookies, we cannot guarantee that you will
                        be able to use our website/app.</p>
                    <p>We use the following types of cookies in our website/app:</p>
                    <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
                    <p>We use essential cookies to make our website/app work. These cookies are strictly necessary to
                        enable core functionality such as security, network management, your cookie preferences and
                        accessibility. Without them you wouldn't be able to use basic services. You may disable these by
                        changing your browser settings, but this may affect how the Websites function.</p>
                    <h3>Performance and Functionality Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website/app but are
                        non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality like videos
                        may become unavailable or you would be required to enter your login details every time you visit
                        the website/app as we would not be able to remember that you had logged in previously.</p>
                    <h3>Marketing Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These account-based marketing cookies enable us to identify future prospects and personalize
                        sales and marketing interactions with them.</p>
                    <h3>Analytics and Customization Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies collect information that is used to help us understand how our website/app is being
                        used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website/app for
                        you.</p>
                    <p>We use cookies served by Google Analytics to collect limited data directly from end-user browsers
                        to enable us to better understand your use of our website/app. Further information on how Google

                    <h3>Social Media Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like”
                        button on our Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social
                        networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The social network will record that you
                        have done this. These cookies may also include certain code that has been placed on the platform
                        to help track conversions from ads, optimize ads based on collected data, build targeted
                        audiences for future ads, and remarket to qualified users who have already taken certain action
                        on the platform.</p>
                    <h3>Third Party Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Some cookies that have been set on our website/app are not set on a first party basis by
                        Unicircle. The Websites can be embedded with content from third parties to serve advertising.
                        These third party service providers may set their own cookies on your web browser. Third party
                        service providers control many of the performance and functionality, advertising, marketing and
                        analytics cookies described above. We do not control the use of these third party cookies as
                        cookies can only be accessed by the third party that originally set them.</p>
                    <h2>How you can manage cookies?</h2>
                    <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their 'settings' preferences. However, if you
                        limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since
                        it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings
                        like login information. Browser manufacturers provide help pages relating to cookie management
                        in their products.</p>

                        but this action may block our essential cookies and prevent our website from functioning
                        properly, and you may not be able to fully utilize all of its features and services. You should
                        also be aware that you may also lose some saved information (e.g. saved login details, site

                        available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your
                        browser, you will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you should visit your
                        browser's help menu for more information.</p>
