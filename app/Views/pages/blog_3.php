                    <p>Imagine two students,<b> Student A</b> and <b>Student B.</b> </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on your student analytics, you already know a lot about them:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Student A:</b> Male, age 18-24 from the Dadar metro area, represented the Under 17 Hockey
                            team
                            for the Asian Games by the Olympic Council of Asia.</li>
                        <li><b>Student B:</b> Male, age 18-24 from the Bandra-Kurla complex area, winner of the ‘World
                            Spelling
                            Bee’ competition.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Students A</b> and <b> B</b> seem pretty similar, don’t they? They’re both males, about the
                        same age bracket
                        and representing their country in prestigious competitions. </p>
                    <p>The same engagement or communication would probably appeal to both, right? </p>
                    <p>Maybe not. </p>
                    <p>Universities and colleges must create a perfect balance for communicating with a variety of their
                        students, all with different challenges, backgrounds, and motivations for pursuing higher
                        education.</p>
                    <p>How do you make sure your message is being delivered to the right person, at the right time?</p>
                    <div class="blog-details">
                        <h2 class=" ">Everything You Need to Know About Student Persona!</h2>
                        <p>A student persona is a “fictional” representation of an actual student and it should be
                            applied in the early stages of student engagement or communication.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, what does that mean for user engagement? Why not use push notifications for colleges
                            and universities that have thousands of students? </p>
                        <p>Creating student personas will help you determine your engagement strategy by segmenting
                            students into different ‘personas’ based on demographics, backgrounds, interests, goals,
                            challenges and so on. </p>
                        <p>Developing a student persona is very important because without knowing who your students are,
                            it’s very difficult to create an effective communication strategy and share information
                            easily with a certain type of student. Without understanding your students inside and out,
                            marketing efforts and student growth can take the risk - you will never be able to offer
                            anything other than a generic message that is designed to ‘catch all’ and hope that it
                            resonates with the majority of your audience. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-details">
                        <h2 class=" ">How to Communicate with Your Institution's Audience</h2>
                        <p>
                            Creating student personas is the most effective way to segment and communicate with your
                            institution's diverse student audience.

                        </p>
                        <p>Personas represent the individual characteristics of a larger group's psychographic profile
                            which offers far more insights than the basic demographic information.
                        </p>
                        <p>Personas for students might include information such as academic interest (say, a math major
                            vs. a business major), intended career, previous sporting experience, and education quotas.
                        </p>
                        <p>Each persona should consist of a name, a background, and a story.</p>
                        <p>Who sounds more engaging to think about: “Prospective Undergraduate: Business Major” or
                            “Vishal, a 17-year old student from Chennai, who competed in his high school’s Cricket Team
                            three years in a row and wants to study M.B.A.?”</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, students will transition from different personas throughout their educational
                            journey. For instance, a traditional student may become a special-needs-student, and then
                            maybe an alumnus.</p>

                        <h2 class=" ">Examples of Marketing Personas in Higher Education</h2>
                        <p>Every university is different. You might have a couple of different personas to put on this
                            list, or you might have a couple you need to remove.
                        </p>

                        <p>But most institutions are going to have a list of personas like the following:</p>
                        <ol class="per-list">
                            <li>Traditional Undergraduates</li>
                            <p>This student is typically 18-22 years old and is attending college full-time. They live
                                away from home for the first time and maybe struggle to balance their academic workload
                                with their social life. They are likely to be engaged in extracurricular activities and
                                may also be working a part-time job.</p>
                            <li>Non-Traditional student</li>
                            <p>This student is typically older than 22 years old and may be attending college part-time
                                or online. They may be balancing their academic commitments with work and family
                                obligations. They may also have different goals than traditional students, such as
                                changing careers or obtaining specific skills for their current job.</p>
                            <li>International student</li>
                            <p>This student is attending college in a country other than their own. They may be
                                attending school on a student visa and may face additional challenges such as language
                                barriers and cultural adjustment. They may also have different goals than domestic
                                students, such as returning to their home country after graduation.</p>
                            <li>First-generation Student</li>
                            <p>This student is the first in their family to attend college. They may have financial or
                                logistical challenges that other students do not face. They may also feel pressure to
                                succeed to set an example for their family.</p>
                            <li>Special needs student</li>
                            <p>This student has a physical, mental, or emotional disability that affects their learning
                                ability in a traditional classroom setting. They may require special accommodations or
                                support services to succeed in college.</p>
                            <li>Student-Athletes</li>

                        <p>Personas are an essential tool for understanding the needs and wants of different types of
                            users in higher education. By creating personas, universities can design programs and
                            services that better meet the needs of their students.
                        </p>
                        <p>Personas can also help universities to identify potential problems and areas for improvement.
                            Ultimately, personas can help universities create a more positive and effective learning
                            environment for all students.</p>
