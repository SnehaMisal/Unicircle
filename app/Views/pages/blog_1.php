                                <p>Along with contributing to academia, it can also support management with various

                                    general community. Let's dive in.
                                    Portals offer many benefits to students, such as:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>There is an easy user interface with all course information at your fingertips.

                                    <li>Faculty can be reached immediately.</li>
                                    <li>Grades, class schedules, and tuition fees are easily accessible.</li>
                                    <li>There are additional activities available for students, such as sports,
                                        community
                                        service projects, and special projects.</li>
                                    <li>A wide range of options and scope.</li>
                                    <li>Student service that is tailored to the student's needs.</li>

                                <h2>A Quality App Is Needed </h2>
                                <p>
                                    Through their phone, students check their bank accounts, make dinner reservations,
                                    call a
                                    ride, watch videos, check concert tickets and get boarding passes. All these things
                                    are done
                                    on their phones, so why should their student portal be different? Student engagement
                                    will
                                    often dwindle if they cannot meet this expectation.

                                </p>
                                <p>Rather than relying on the fact that an app exists, students tend not to use it. They
                                    need
                                    the app to provide them with all the information and functionality they need. The
                                    app should
                                    be visually appealing and easy to use (just like a consumer app).</p>
                                <p>For student portal engagement to be high, institutions need to reach out wherever
                                    their
                                    students are. It means offering a mobile and web portal experience that students
                                    will find
                                    useful.</p>

                                <p>For a student portal to be successful, it must offer a seamless experience across
                                    devices.
                                    Both the mobile and web portal must provide the same features, information, tools
                                    and
                                    capabilities for three reasons:

                                    <li>It's not useful if students aren't engaged. No matter what device they are
                                        using, they
                                        expect the same access. </li>
                                    <li>You may not be able to provide all the information and resources you need to
                                        some

                                    <li>A mobile app is an excellent tool for students even if they have easy computer

                                </ul>
                                <p>Many schools launch separate mobile apps unrelated to their students' portals. You
                                    can also
                                    opt for a mobile-optimized website or a skeleton version of the site. Often, this
                                    approach
                                    is unsuccessful and doesn't align with what students want, need, or expect.</p>

                                    There is a tendency to assume that all students have access to a computer, whether

                                    one at home or in a campus computer lab. The fact is that 40 percent of students
                                    have
                                    difficulty using computers.

                                    may still experience difficulties accessing on-campus computers during operating

                                        managing the platform has twice as much work. If you want to manage everything
                                        from one
                                        portal, find one that natively optimizes it and pushes it out to all devices, so
                                        you
                                        don't need to worry about it.</p>

                                        using their mobile device. Native mobile apps are responsible for nearly 80% of
                                        that

                                        apps offer students mobile interaction features that they're used to. Even if a
                                        web
                                        portal is optimized for mobile, it will never perform well as a native app or
                                        offer the
                                        same functionality.</p>
                                    <li>Device-specific portal interfaces are required.</li>
                                    <p>An app can't simply be plugged into your web portal interface to transform it
                                        into a
                                        native mobile app. It can be very problematic since students use apps very
                                        often.
                                        Students will abandon apps that are difficult to use, confusing or ugly. A
                                        sleek,
                                        intuitive mobile interface that isn't over cluttered is what your students
                                        expect.
                                        Moreover, working with a web portal naturally gives you more space to work with,
                                        and, on
                                        a computer screen, a mobile-inspired UI wouldn't make sense. Even though the
                                        information
                                        you present will be the same, how it is presented should be tailored to suit
                                        each
                                        device. Take a look at consumer apps (like Facebook or Spotify) commonly used on
                                        both
                                        desktop and mobile platforms. All their features are identical, but their design
                                        varies
                                        by device for a better user experience.</p>

                                    Keeping up with student needs and wants is a constant concern for universities. They
                                    have to
                                    do so as long as they want to stay relevant, keep student satisfaction high, and
                                    attract new
                                    potential students.

                                <p>Finding the right balance between technology and student demands is a critical part

                                    process. In today's higher education institutions, a student portal that offers both

                                    and a mobile option is essential.</p>
